Basic Concepts of Promises Exercises:

Create a basic Promise that resolves.
Create a Promise that rejects.
Create a Promise that resolves after a delay using setTimeout.
Create a Promise that rejects after a delay.
Chain .then() to a resolved Promise.
Chain .catch() to a rejected Promise.
Chain multiple .then() handlers.
Chain .then() and .catch() handlers.
Use .finally() to execute code regardless of Promise state.

Promise States:

Check if a Promise is pending.
Check if a Promise is resolved.
Check if a Promise is rejected.
Check the value of a resolved Promise.
Handle errors in a rejected Promise.

Promise Resolving and Rejecting:

Create a function that returns a resolved Promise with a custom value.
Create a function that returns a rejected Promise with a custom error message.
Use Promise.resolve() to create a resolved Promise.
Use Promise.reject() to create a rejected Promise.

Promise All and Promise Race:

Use Promise.all() to wait for multiple Promises to resolve.
Use Promise.race() to get the result of the first resolving Promise.

Promisify Callback Functions:

Convert a callback-based function into a Promise-based function using util.promisify.
Promisify a function with multiple arguments.

Async/Await:

Create an async function that uses await to resolve a Promise.
Handle errors with async/await.
Chain multiple await calls in an async function.

Error Handling:

Create a function that wraps a Promise and handles errors.
Handle multiple errors in a Promise chain.
Handle errors in an async/await function.

Promise Chaining:

Create a chain of Promises that depend on each other.
Chain Promises with different data types.
Create a Promise chain with conditional logic.
Use .then() to transform data in a Promise chain.
Use .then() to filter results in a Promise chain.

Promise Handling in Loops:

Use Promises with a for loop.
Use Promises with a while loop.
Use Promises with a for...of loop.

Timeouts and Intervals:

Create a Promise that resolves after a specific timeout.
Create a Promise that rejects after a specific timeout.
Use setInterval with Promises.

Promise Libraries:

Use the bluebird library to work with Promises.
Use the q library to work with Promises.
Use the when library to work with Promises.

Promise Anti-Patterns:

Create a Promise anti-pattern (callback inside a Promise constructor).
Create a Promise anti-pattern (not returning a Promise).

Advanced Promise Topics:

Implement a custom Promise class.
Create a Promise that handles progress.
Create a Promise with multiple resolve and reject calls.
Use Promise.any() to resolve with the first resolved Promise.
Use Promise.allSettled() to wait for all Promises to settle.

Promise Best Practices:

Avoid the "Pyramid of Doom" by chaining .then() calls.
Use named functions as .then() and .catch() handlers.
Use async/await for cleaner asynchronous code.
Always handle errors in Promises.

Promise Patterns:

Implement the "retry" pattern with Promises.
Implement the "parallel" pattern with Promises.
Implement the "sequential" pattern with Promises.

Promise Testing:

Write unit tests for Promise-based functions.
Use tools like jest or Mocha for Promise testing.

Promise Performance:

Compare the performance of Promises with callbacks.

Promise Integration:

Integrate Promises with other libraries or frameworks (e.g., React, Express.js).

Promise Debugging Tools:

Use Promise debugging tools like bluebird's long stack traces.

Promises in Different Environments:

// Scopes and Closures

// Basic Scope Exercises:

// Create a variable in the global scope.
// Create a variable inside a function and try to access it outside the function. What happens?
// Create a variable inside a function and access it inside the same function. Is it accessible?
// Create a variable inside a function using the var keyword and try to access it outside the function.
// Create a variable inside a function using the let keyword and try to access it outside the function.
// Create a variable inside a function using the const keyword and try to access it outside the function.
// Create two variables with the same name, one in the global scope and one inside a function. What happens when you access that variable?
// Define a function inside another function and try to access variables from both functions.
// Create a variable inside a block (using {}) and try to access it outside the block.
// Create a variable inside a block (using {}) and try to access it inside the block. Is it accessible?

// Closures Exercises:

// Create a function that returns another function. What happens when you call the outer function and then the inner function?
// Create a closure that captures a variable from the outer scope and prints its value.
// Create a function that takes a parameter and returns a function that uses that parameter.
// Create a counter function using closures that increments a value each time it's called.
// Create a function that keeps track of the total number of function calls.
// Create a function that calculates the sum of two numbers and returns a closure to compute the sum.
// Create a function that generates a random number between two specified values and returns it as a closure.
// Create a function that memoizes the results of expensive function calls using closures.
// Create a function that logs the timestamp of each function call.
// Create a function that checks if a given number is even or odd using a closure.




// Advanced Scope and Closure Exercises:

// Write a function that creates a private counter using closure, allowing you to increment and get its value.
// Create a module pattern using closures to encapsulate private variables and methods.
// Implement a simple event emitter using closures.
// Create a function that returns a new array with values multiplied by a given factor.
// Write a function that delays the execution of another function by a specified number of milliseconds using closures.
// Create a function that adds event listeners to HTML elements and allows removing them.
// Implement a simple caching system for a function using closures.
// Build a lightweight promise-like structure using closures.
// Create a function that filters an array of objects based on a specified property and value.
// Write a function that validates email addresses using regular expressions within a closure.

// Nested Scope Exercises:

// Create a function that has a nested function. Try to access variables from the outer and inner functions.
// Write a function that generates a random number within a specified range inside a loop.
// Create a function that generates a multiplication table for a given number.

// Write a function that fetches data from an API and caches it using closures.
// Implement a promise-like function using closures for handling asynchronous operations.
// Build a simple pub/sub (publish/subscribe) system using closures.
// Create a function that performs debouncing using closures for input events.
// Write a function that throttles the execution of a callback using closures.

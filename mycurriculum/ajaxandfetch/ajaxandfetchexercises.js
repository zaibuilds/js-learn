// AJAX and Fetch Exercises

// Level 1: Basic Concepts

// Create an XMLHttpRequest to fetch data from a simple JSON file.
// Use the onreadystatechange event to handle the response in an XMLHttpRequest.
// Fetch data from an API using the Fetch API and log the response to the console.
// Handle errors when making a Fetch request.
// Make a GET request using Fetch and display the data on a webpage.
// Make a POST request using Fetch to submit data to a server.
// Convert a Fetch response to JSON and access specific properties.
// Use the async/await syntax to make a Fetch request and handle the response.
// Implement a loading spinner while waiting for a Fetch request to complete.
// Create a function to make a Fetch request with different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

// Level 2: Working with APIs

// Fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API and display the current weather for a specific location.
// Create a search bar that sends Fetch requests to the Giphy API and displays GIFs based on user input.
// Fetch data from the GitHub API to display a user's repositories and profile information.
// Build a currency converter using an API that provides exchange rates.
// Fetch data from a RESTful API and implement pagination to display multiple pages of results.
// Use Fetch to interact with a public JSONPlaceholder API to simulate CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
// Implement authentication with Fetch, obtaining a token and sending it with subsequent requests.
// Create a simple weather app that fetches data from multiple weather APIs and displays the information.
// Fetch data from the NASA API to display the "Astronomy Picture of the Day" on a webpage.
// Build a news aggregator that fetches and displays news articles from various sources using an API.



// Level 3: Advanced Topics

// Implement request throttling and debouncing for Fetch requests.
// Create a real-time chat application using Fetch and server-sent events (SSE).
// Fetch data from a GraphQL API and perform queries and mutations.
// Use Fetch and WebSockets to build a live cryptocurrency price tracker.
// Fetch data from a RESTful API and implement client-side caching to reduce redundant requests.
// Build a file upload component using Fetch and FormData.
// Create a single-page application (SPA) that uses Fetch to load content dynamically.
// Implement token refresh logic when using authentication with Fetch.
// Fetch data from an API that requires OAuth 2.0 authorization and obtain access tokens.
// Build a task management application with Fetch that allows users to create, update, and delete tasks.

// Level 4: Error Handling and Security

// Handle network errors gracefully with Fetch, including timeouts and offline scenarios.
// Implement Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) handling in Fetch requests.
// Use Fetch to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
// Securely store and manage API keys when making Fetch requests.
// Implement rate limiting and IP blocking for abusive Fetch requests.
// Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers when making Fetch requests to enhance security.
// Fetch data from a secure API that requires client certificates for authentication.
// Handle authentication and authorization errors when using Fetch.
// Implement OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with Fetch for a third-party API.
// Build a secure authentication flow using Fetch and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

// Level 5: Performance Optimization

// Optimize Fetch requests for mobile devices and slow network connections.
// Use HTTP/2 with Fetch to improve loading times for multiple resources.
// Implement request batching with Fetch to reduce the number of requests made.
// Fetch and lazy load images as the user scrolls down a webpage.
// Minimize the use of Fetch for redundant data by implementing local caching.
// Optimize Fetch requests for internationalization and localization.
// Implement server-side rendering (SSR) and Fetch for improved initial page load performance.
// Use service workers and Fetch for caching and offline support in a Progressive Web App (PWA).
// Implement data prefetching and preloading with Fetch to improve user experience.
// Optimize Fetch requests for SEO by ensuring proper server-side rendering and indexing.
